00:00:02,736 --> 00:00:09,687
Opening Event - bios

2
00:00:09,687 --> 00:00:14,036
Good morning, Hamburg, not Berlin

3
00:00:14,036 --> 00:00:18,931
This is not the keynote, so if you need anything important to do,

4
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:22,910
get it done, the keynote will 
start in a few minutes

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:38,605
and by the way, I am not Jacob, I am bios, hello!

6
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:40,748
one slight technical problem...

7
00:00:40,748 --> 00:00:51,085
okay, the first slide doesn't show (yet)

8
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,547
No, no, it's not powerpoint,

9
00:00:52,547 --> 00:01:02,535
it's free, it's better,  it's libreoffice.

10
00:01:02,535 --> 00:01:08,104
This is not the keynote, we already covered this, so...

11
00:01:08,104 --> 00:01:17,099
Big important changes: It's crazy how many of you are here at this early hour in the morning, it is basically still at night

12
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:22,701
and cool to see that you all managed to the right location

13
00:01:22,701 --> 00:01:25,854
we mentioned this, I think the stream is already up,

14
00:01:25,854 --> 00:01:29,089
so if anyone is in Berlin and sees the stream, I don't know

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,633
if the bcc shows the stream; 
there is still some time to get here

16
00:01:33,633 --> 00:01:39,571
the train takes about two hours;
I had that problem yesterday

17
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:43,488
And welcome everyone! Great to see you!

18
00:01:43,488 --> 00:01:49,287
I you have a talk

19
00:01:49,287 --> 00:01:50,814
one warning to the fellow speakers:

20
00:01:50,814 --> 00:01:53,619
if you have a talk tomorrow

21
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:58,808
or a talk where some time is available

22
00:01:58,808 --> 00:02:01,463
to get up to the stage here,

23
00:02:01,463 --> 00:02:06,062
this room is amazing and a bit scary

24
00:02:06,062 --> 00:02:09,800
People all around me!

25
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,682
Okay, let's get started!

26
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:17,004
Some new things we have this year here:
we have the hackcenter as every year,

27
00:02:17,004 --> 00:02:20,807
But we also have assemblies. 
Hopefully, Most of you already

28
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:25,670
saw this in the wiki and on the blog, because now it is too late to start an assembly

29
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,276
because all the space is distributed to the assemblies.

30
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:34,224
and When you walk around the building you will see some signs

31
00:02:34,224 --> 00:02:39,200
announcing the assembly which has been placed there

32
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,321
there are also some "shared" tables. The Meaning

33
00:02:42,321 --> 00:02:49,230
is a bit of the shared situation; first I thought I can just go there and grab a seat,

34
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:52,511
but shared spaces are meant for the assemblies,

35
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:59,238
so if they hold a talk or hold a workshop, they can use the shared space

36
00:02:59,238 --> 00:03:06,218
so if you squat there, they will probably ask very politely to move away.

37
00:03:06,218 --> 00:03:10,464
But you have to give up the seat there.

38
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,670
In the wiki you can also see which assemblies have workshops

39
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,077
and many assemblies also will give talks,

40
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:23,830
so probably there will be a timetable in the wiki

41
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,521
where you can see where which shared space will be used.

42
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:29,121
for some assembly business.

43
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,805
What else? we had a presale this year again, unfortunately, we

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:39,199
couldn't implement the much asked feature of "Bad Gateway",

45
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:44,449
a very famous german holiday place,

46
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:47,777
but we managed to sell many tickets,

47
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:51,387
we will give some statistics at the closing event.

48
00:03:51,387 --> 00:03:53,555
There are still some tickets on sale, so

49
00:03:53,555 --> 00:03:57,651
if you see the stream, you can come and get a tcket.

50
00:03:57,651 --> 00:04:00,620
I think we have about 1000 tickets per day,

51
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:04,014
so there should be a ticket for everyone.

52
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:27,871
Yeah, Also in the presale ticket system, hopefully

53
00:04:27,871 --> 00:04:38,347
everyone who wanted some clothes already ordered it., because

54
00:04:38,347 --> 00:04:43,307
I am not sure how many tshirts we will have left after the congress,

55
00:04:43,307 --> 00:04:47,218
but if you ordered, please collect it today.

56
00:04:47,218 --> 00:04:53,527
If you can't, come to the congress today, write us an email or

57
00:04:53,527 --> 00:05:00,516
annonce it, otherweise we will distribute the not-fetched t-shirts tomorrow.

58
00:05:00,516 --> 00:05:08,468
It is really important, so do it today.

59
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:14,311
We have a "Fahrplan"

60
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,871
since yesterday evening; we have version 1.0

61
00:05:16,871 --> 00:05:19,817
but  I think it is already outdated.

62
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:30,214
And we have these paper plans, they are really great including a map of the building

63
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:34,637
the version on the paper is already outdated.

64
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:39,099
I think one room appeared out of nowhere and is now on the Fahrplan.

65
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:42,413
So, check the online version and twitter will announce updates.

66
00:05:42,413 --> 00:05:46,795
Yeah, Volunteers: really, really important.

67
00:05:46,795 --> 00:05:50,650
If you walk around the building and interact with the people here,

68
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:59,637
nearly everyone but I think if you walk around in the public areas, you interact with is volunteering, so be nice.

69
00:05:59,658 --> 00:06:05,536
If you are at the bar and they run temporary out of mate, be nice,

70
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:10,784
wait a minute and evenb better, go ask if you can help them.

71
00:06:10,784 --> 00:06:13,349
we have an angel meeting, I believe one is right now,

72
00:06:13,619 --> 00:06:22,193
but the next will be in the evening, so ask there what you can help, just go there, and ask what you can do.

73
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,698
we also have an online version, the "Engelsystem",

74
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:33,637
you can also register there and sign some shifts, so eg the Video-Angels around here are volunteers.

75
00:06:33,637 --> 00:06:48,429
All the poeple behind the nice blinking lights are volunteers

76
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:51,589
okay, and one update to the talks: There will be translations!

77
00:06:51,589 --> 00:06:54,719
Last Minute information here, Hi,

78
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:01,491
So we are trying to setting up a live translator team,

79
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,863
we've got around ten people right now,

80
00:07:02,863 --> 00:07:06,178
everybody fluent in english and understanding german

81
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:08,548
quite enough is welcome to join us,

82
00:07:08,548 --> 00:07:13,228
we are meeting   at 11:30 out here, follow the blog, there is a post as well,

83
00:07:13,228 --> 00:07:17,257
we need people to help us with live translations, and we are trying to do

84
00:07:17,257 --> 00:07:25,434
all 27 german talks into english, and there will be live stream for that, and there will be recordings,

85
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:32,455
so if you don't understand enough german, all german talks will at least be attempted to be translated in english.

86
00:07:32,455 --> 00:07:45,930
there might be also a DECT Channel for the translation, I am not entirely sure about that, please check the wiki.

87
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,651
Thanks!

88
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:57,874
Okay, hopefully, nothing urgent or extreme will happen, but if you are in some kind of emergency,

89
00:07:57,874 --> 00:08:02,178
I don't know, you cut yourself, you touch the wrong end of the soldering item,

90
00:08:02,178 --> 00:08:07,123
we have a medical team standing by, they are next to the cash desk,

91
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:17,012
you can call them, you can call 112 or 911, but please make sure you are on DECT.

92
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:24,575
Don't call them on GSM if you are bored and need someone to hang out.

93
00:08:24,898 --> 00:08:28,990
Apparently that has happened before.

94
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:39,873
New this year, we had it last year, but I don't think it wasn't so organized as this year;

95
00:08:39,873 --> 00:08:41,710
we have a network abuse team, so if you you are on the stream

96
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:45,668
and happen to be a network provider and something strange is happening on your network

97
00:08:45,668 --> 00:08:48,083
and you suspect we're to blame,

98
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:56,535
I think the full page for abuse handeling is also online or check the RIPE-Entry.

99
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:59,047
You probably know what to do.

100
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:11,365
Yeah but we also have some abuse and ani-harrassment team, they're available at 113

101
00:09:11,365 --> 00:09:19,587
and they also provide deescalation services, so if you have some problems

102
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:22,244
or if somethings strange is happening, just give them a call

103
00:09:22,244 --> 00:09:37,395
and they will talk to you and will try to help you.

104
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:39,548
okay, so, we are nearly at the end.

105
00:09:39,548 --> 00:09:47,484
More information: you probably know it, we have a wiki which is really extensive and updated all the time,

106
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:52,042
so check it, there will be much to discover.

107
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:57,291
we have the infodesk again, they are also down at the entrance.

108
00:09:57,291 --> 00:10:04,007
really, get a map, I got lost already I think three times yesterday, trying to find some area, and it was like

109
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:10,006
"it used to be there, but I was on the wrong floor, and there are sub-floors" and

110
00:10:10,006 --> 00:10:16,344
the maps are great! Wander around, Discover all the stuff,

111
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:20,705
There is much to see, this building is really, really huge

112
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:27,289
Also, have fun and keep on hacking, be excellent to each other, and thanks for listening.

113
00:10:34,852 --> 00:10:40,696
So, we are making about five minutes of minutes of break

114
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:46,464
to set up everything and then you'll see the next speaker, the keynote
